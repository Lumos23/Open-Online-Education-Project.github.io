Open Online Education Platform (OOEP) is a group of students, faculty, and technologists seeking to redefine higher education institutions’ approach to the shift to online education. 

Since the pandemic hit, educational institutions and individuals have been working on technology solutions to the shift to online education independently. The Open EdTech Community OOEP brings together these efforts to curate a culture of collaborative EdTech problem-solving. Acting as a centralized platform, it will help aspiring developers connect with and form projects, facilitating inter-project communication to tackle the challenges of online education.  We envision it to be a community where people can share, develop, and adopt open-source tools together. The community will likely be hosted on Slack/ Discord.

## Vision:
* Support Open-Source edTech development by connecting projects with developers, technical support, and educational partners for adoption
* Support higher education partners by providing open-source tools for online classroom and assisting with installation and maintenance.
* This initiative is growing out of Harvard and MIT that pushes for the adoption of open-source tools by setting up technical and administrative support.

That is, there are three spokes to this system: 
* Open-Source development projects and individual developers
* Educational Partners
* OOEP staff and other student organizations facilitating the collaboration.

We want to launch a collaborative hub of developers working on open-source tech serving higher education that is supported in practical manners by various partners (for example hosting from Harvard iLabs) and connect this hub with university partners for testing out tools (for example Learning Labs and Teaching and Learning Labs).

**We look forward to working together with interested students on MIT UA to in organizing the community and building connections. You can decide on how involved you want to be with the project. We’d love to have you as an organizer for the community (be involved in overall planning and team management) if this is something you’re interested in and have the time commitment for. But any help reaching out to MIT resources and building out connections will be greatly appreciated as well. We’re trying to expand both technology and education connections, some elaboration on these partnerships can be found below.**

**This is a new initiative in active development, and your ideas will play an important role in shaping how this project will evolve in the months ahead.**
