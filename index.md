The Open Online Education Project (OOEP) aims to expand and improve online education by:

* Developing open-source online educational tools.
* Advocating for the publishing of free online education materials
* Creating collaborations between institutions to address problems in online education.
* Collecting and distributing resources for online education

We are a group of students, faculty, and technologists, growing out of Harvard and MIT, working on online education at the university level. We believe online education naturally lends itself to collaboration and needs further development. OOEP consists of a coalition of [projects](https://ooep.org/projects) and partners.

OOEP abides by the following principles:

* We are not for profit
* We are inter-university
* Our projects are open and freely available: Development is open-source, findings in our research and collaborations will be published for free

We believe in supporting everyone in online education regardless of whether they abide by these principles. For example,  even if you do not publish your course materials, we still want to work with you.

We believe online education offers unique opportunities; it is not simply a downgrade from in-person education. The online space provides a landscape of connection, accessibility, and technical capability entirely different from in person education.
