The Open Online Education Project (OOEP) is a group of students, faculty, and technologists, growing out of Harvard and MIT, which aims to:

* Develop open-source online education tools.
* Advocate publishing of free online education materials
* Create collaborations between institutions to address problems in online education. 
* Collect and distribute resources for online education

We work on online education at the university level. We believe that online education is a field that naturally lends itself to collaboration and that development in it is something that is needed right now. OOEP is comprised of a coalition of projects (link board) and partners (link partner list). 

In the interest of keeping things open, OOEP abides by the following principles:

* We are not profit-seeking (nor profit making).
* We are inter-university
* OOEP Projects are open and freely available: Development is open-source, findings in our research and collaborations will be published for free.

We believe in helping everyone in online education regardless of if they follow these principles. That is, even if you are not a course that publishes your course materials freely, we can and want to work with you.

We believe in the possibilities of online education. We do not view it as simply a downgrade from in person education. The online space offers unique landscape of connection, accessibility, and technical capability which is wholly different to in person education.
