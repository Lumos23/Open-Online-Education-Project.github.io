# Advocacy Projects
## Open Course Materials Initiative (OCMI)
**Project managers:** Leo Alcock/ Professor Erik Demaine

**Current members:**
* **Organizers:** Leo Alcock, Erik Demaine, David Andrade, Lucy He, Freyja Quinn, Erik Swanson
* **Development:** Erik Demaine, Freyja Quinn, Sammota Mwakalobo, Mohammed Guerrab, Ahmed Hasan
* **Canvassers:** Leo Alcock, David Andrade, Lucy He, Erik Swanson, Suhaas Bhat, Grace Kim, Sam Lowry, Kalyan Palepu, Julio Perez, Samuel Buckley-Bonnano, Billy Beauregard

**Motivation:** As universities across the country switch to remote education, we ask the question: What is stopping them from publishing their course materials for free online? This project aims to answer this question, develop technical and practical solutions for them, and push for open publishing of course materials online. This could be a giant step forward in accessibility in higher education requiring relatively little additional work. Even at schools that already publish materials online, further materials could be made available.

**Working Plan:** At the highest level, we plan to start with Harvard and convince them to support this cause and then after spread out to other universities. This involves gathering support and information from faculty members at Harvard.

**Background:** MIT OCW is a free online catalog of course resources curated at MIT that allows students  across the world to explore a wide range of topics and courses offered at MIT. These course materials can include video lectures, lecture notes, presentation slides, and problem sets and solutions for the given year. While this system has been successful at MIT, Harvard has no such analog that is accessible or free. While Harvard does offer edX courses and offers some courses online, it lacks the breadth and depth of free course resources that could be offered. 

**Deliverables:**
* Building a coalition of canvassers to reach out to faculty members. This is with the goal of discussing problems with publishing course materials and getting support on open material collection/support for OCMI. 
* Building a community of developers to work, track, and improve upon the OCMI prototype, based on the current OCW system. 

**Desired skills:**

For organizers [6+ hr/wk]: 
* A passion for online education!
* Effective communication skills 
* Experience with advocacy efforts

For developers [5+ hr/wk]: 
* Graphic and UI/UX design.
* Python and JavaScript/CoffeeScript coding. 
* Scaling large web apps.

For canvassers [2+ hr/wk]:
* Be a Harvard Student

## Affordable Internet Initiative
**Project manager:** David Andrade

**Current members:** David Andrade, Mathew Kuruvilla

**Motivation/Background:** One of the barriers to an effective online education is access to reliable Internet. According to the FCC, more than 19 million people still do not have access to reliable high-speed Internet across the US. This is especially true in densely populated poor communities and rural areas. Even the FCC concluded broadband is not yet being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion, and that they want to  “further examine the role of mobile services and next-generation, high-speed services” in increasing Internet accessibility. 
There are two problems at play here. Rural areas lack access because Internet companies don’t find it economically beneficial to extend Internet access to such areas - therefore, good Internet is just not accessible. Dense urban centers lack access because poorer communities cannot overcome the high prices of the Internet. Though we are exploring different options to increase internet accessibility in both cases, our initial focus is on solving the financial barrier problem for dense urban areas.

**Deliverables:**
* Connect with community leaders and building managers in dense urban areas to provide cheap Internet access to tenants
* Find grants/funding that would help cover the costs of implementing a solution
* Evaluate costs, and if possible, apply this approach as a way to implement municipal broadband.
* Determine and research current plans on how to deliver Internet to underprivileged communities, and develop a specific framework for implementation.


# Development Projects
## Lectr 
**Project manager:** Professor Erik Demaine

**Current members:** Professor Erik Demaine, Jennfier Guo, Michael Kielstra, Angelika Antsmae

**Motivation/Background:** Online materials need to be accessible and easy to navigate in an online world. Things such as lecture notes, presentations, lecture video, homework sets and solutions should be easy to access for all students to ensure students have the easiest learning experience and that they are most encouraged to seek out course resources. This project attempts to best perform this function, by creating an online resource that allows for such features like: synchronized lecture notes with video, well-placed links with problems and solutions, etc. We are currently developing a GUI which allows instructors to create course pages with synchronized lecture notes with video in a form similar to this. This resource allows for easy access to professors who are not technically-versed in code with a GUI system, allowing them to easily upload the items they want. We are currently working with the math department to build a prototype of this resource for the professors to use.

**Deliverables:**
* Develop Lectr: a self-hosted, easy-to-install system whereby professors without specialized technical training or computer science expertise can upload lecture notes, slides, and other supplementary materials, and synchronize them to timesteps in a video of the lecture (which we currently believe will be hosted on YouTube).  Students can then watch the video online with the materials next to it, allowing them to much better understand what’s going through the lecturer’s mind.
* Simplify installation process and create user guide.
* Provide ongoing support.

**Desired skills:**
* Graphic and UI/UX design.
* Python and JavaScript/CoffeeScript coding.
* Scaling large web apps.

## Cocreate
**Project manager:** Professor Erik Demaine

**Current members:** Professor Erik Demaine, Cathy Cai, Mohammed Guerrab, Ahmed Baky

**Repository:** [https://github.com/edemaine/cocreate](https://github.com/edemaine/cocreate)

**Motivation/Background:** Online collaboration, often restricted to text or voice chat, does not make it easy to use the complex symbols that are the lifeblood of many scientific disciplines.  Cocreate, an open-source, ad-hoc interactive whiteboard system, makes this much easier.  While interactive whiteboards do exist already, many of them are tied to specific video-call systems, some require creating user accounts, and few are self-hostable and open source.  Cocreate, on the other hand, makes cooperative whiteboarding as simple as going to the server, getting a link, and sharing that ilnk with your collaborators.

**Deliverables:**
* Develop Cocreate: a self-hosted, easy-to-install system whereby users without specialized technical training or computer science expertise can collaborate via shared online whiteboards with low latency and advanced features.
* Simplify installation process and create user guide.
* Provide ongoing support.

**Desired skills:**
* Graphic and UI/UX design.
* Python and JavaScript/CoffeeScript coding.
* Scaling large web apps.

## Coauthor
**Project manager:** Professor Erik Demaine

**Current members:** Professor Erik Demaine

**Repository:** [https://github.com/edemaine/coauthor](https://github.com/edemaine/coauthor)

**Motivation/Background:** Mathematicians have a hard time texting each other.  Quite beyond the inability of a 26-letter alphabet to succinctly express most mathematical ideas, they struggle with the fact that online fora, email chains, and the like are set up to provide a single timeline, an authoritative history of a conversation, with each contribution irrevocably associated with its author.  This is not a good model for the free ebb and flow of ideas which characterize mathematical collaboration.  Coauthor is a message board with a difference.  Posts can be edited, reordered, and even reparented as the discussion requires, all in an environment which supports Markdown and LaTeX.  This allows for a new kind of remote work, one in which the egos of the academics are secondary to the project itself.  The software is self-hosted and not hard to set up, and is currently being used in some parts of AGITTOC.

**Deliverables:**
* Provide ongoing support for existing installs of Coauthor.
* Study the behaviour of Coauthor “in the wild” to better set system requirements.

**Desired skills:** Erik is managing development of Coauthor by himself for the moment.  If you are interested in working on Coauthor specifically, please get in touch.

## Circle ℤ
**Project manager:** Professor Jim Fowler

**Current members:** Professor Jim Fowler

**Repository:** [https://github.com/rossprogram/Circle Z](https://github.com/rossprogram/Circle Z)

**Motivation/Background:** With classes being moved online, students are missing their collaborative learning communities more than ever. Circle Z provides chat rooms with TeX integrated with Mumble for low-latency audio, shared whiteboards, collaborative real-time TeX editors, pre-recorded lecture video and live streaming viewers, a client-side TeX environment and DVI viewer. Inside each chat room, you may import PDFs into the whiteboard, and may write there if you have a touchscreen or tablet. There is also a grading queue for managing homework submissions. 
Circle Z helps recreate the collaborative learning environment, especially in math and sciences. Circle Z is currently the platform used for Ross Mathematics Program online.


**Deliverables:**
* Frontend: Prepare Circle Z to be accessed more easily, such as by transferring to a web server. Work on creating an easy-to-use installation process/guide. 
* Backend: Hosting, securating of documents

**Desired skills:** Web Dev and other experience related to the functionalities of Circle Z. Please get in touch for more details.

# Miscellaneous Projects

## ResearchSeminars.org
**Project Managers:** Edgar Costa and David Roe
**Current Members:** Drew Sutherland, Bjorn Poonen, and many others. 

**Motivation/Background:** researchseminars.org is a crowd-sourced platform where researchers can share links to their seminars. The switch towards remote academics has extended the reach of research seminars, which were often only accessible to those who could attend in person. This provides a wealth of opportunities for sharing the latest research to people anywhere. Researchseminars.org provides an ongoing, updated list of virtually accessible research seminars, conferences, as well as allowing for the posting of related material. At the moment, researchseminars.org mostly contains mathematics seminars, however, we aim to cover a wide range of fields and topics.

**Deliverables:**
* Software Development for the researchseminars.org platform
* Reaching other research areas/communities for the site to host
* Adding content to the site.

**Desired Skills:**
* Software Developers
* Connection and understanding of research communities in academia


## Course Partnerships
**Project Manager:** Lucy He

**Current Members:** Leo Alcock, Professor Erik Demaine, David Andrade, Lucy He, Michael Kielstra, Angelika Antsmae, Mathew Kuruvilla

**Motivation/Background:** The goal of this project is to establish connections and collaborations with other institutions’ online courses to address online education goals. There is a wide range of flexibility to what a course partnership can be. A course partnership can be as simple as establishing a connection between OOEP and a specific summer course for resources and problem sharing. On the other hand, it can be testing out OOEP tools and gathering feedback regularly from partner courses on what works and what can be improved/made better about the tool/experience. It can even be finding similar online education research programs at universities and reaching and discussing linking the similar courses up, and sharing the resources available. If applicable, the course manager can be part of the course community to see how well the tool works for the course first-hand.

**Deliverables:**
* Coordinating what tools/resources would be useful/applicable to improving the course experience with the course head
* Developing a loop of feedback (e.g. frequency, what questions to ask students) between the course manager and course head on what can be improved and or done to improve the course experience
* Using feedback from previous courses collected in a file to inform future course questions and decisions
* Create a repository of available resources and tools being developed and searched for at OOEP that could be useful for potential partner courses

**Current Partners:**
* Algebraic Geometry In the Time of Covid (AGITTOC)
* MIT Summer HSSP
* Euler Circle

## The Educational Resource Handbook
**Project Manager:** David Andrade
**Current members:** David Andrade

**Motivation/Background:** Many universities across the US are opting to have a semester assisted by or fully consisting of online learning. When universities first scrambled to collect resources for faculty after the COVID-19 outbreak, many of these published resources, while it kept courses above water for the rest of the semester, would not be enough to prepare and help both students and faculty in a true online semester.As professors have had more time over the summer to properly plan for online courses, some are unaware of the vast amounts of free online tools and resources available to remedy common online teaching problems.
The purpose of this project is to expand upon the resources collected by institutions during the outbreak and create a fuller, fleshed-out repository of resources available to all faculty and students across the nation. It would emphasize the wide range of solutions (in terms of advice or online tools/resources discovered) that professors across the country have developed to common online/residential education problems and collect them all in one place for all professors to see. It would also discuss the advantages/disadvantages of similar resources and find tools by use in different subjects/disciplines (e.g. humanities, computer science, engineering, etc.)
This handbook would also take into account the collective experience and thoughts on what worked/didn’t of faculty this semester. It would also include unique ways in which professors adapted their courses with an online environment. It would finally include tips from professors on what different class subjects (e.g. studio arts, math, engineering) can do in adapting to most improve a student’s learning experience. 

Deliverables:
* Collaborate to find tools and resources professors can use to solve common online educational problems
* Collect faculty input on what could be improved and what solutions they came up with to remedy an online semester.
* Synthesize student and faculty data on finding novel solutions to common online problems.
* Research how different class types (arts, engineering, math) can each improve their classes with educational resources/tools to maximize student success.


## Research and Outreach Team

**Project Manager:** David Andrade, Lucy He

**Current members:** David Andrade, Lucy He, Daniel Weiss, Mathew Kuruvilla, Samuel Buckley-Bonanno, Jordan Barton

**Repository:** [https://github.com/roed314/seminars](https://github.com/roed314/seminars)

**Motivation/Background:** The purpose of this project is two-fold.The first objective is to identify and address novel problems in online education. This first objective involves the identification of tools, resources, and organizations online that professors will want to use, implement, or connect with. After discovery of this tool, resource, or organization, the resource may be shared with professors who may benefit from implementing a tool in their course or an organization helping with course development. It can also be shared with OOEP in-house developers, who may be interested in collaborating with the resource’s owners to improve and iterate the tool with feedback and new ideas. In the second scenario, a member may look to establishing a connection with the tool, resource, or organization.
The second objective as a member of this team is to establish connections with professors and administrations. Once the first step of discovery is made, the tools and resources would ideally be shared with faculty and administrators. However, this connection becomes deeper; it would be beneficial to collect their thoughts on online education and ideas they have on how to carry out online learning. This could also involve the collection and management of data regarding student/faculty input on problems in online learning. 

**Deliverables:**
* Discover resources, tools, and organizations that can benefit online learning and course development
* Facilitate and maintain relationships between faculty and the resources, including a feedback loop of what can be improved
* Identify opportunities for tool development that the OOEP Development team can aid in collaborating with
* Collecting feedback and data on professor and student thoughts on concerns with online education and what ideas exist to improve it
