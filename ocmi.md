The Open Course Materials Initiative (OCMI) is an advocacy effort led by Harvard students pushing for open course material sharing at universities. The pandemic has had two key effects in higher education:
* A severe crippling of higher education - hitting underresourced communities the hardest 
* A widespread shift to online education formats in higher education.

These two factors present a sharp need and opportunity for universities to support students, educators, and anyone with less access to higher education by allowing and encouraging instructors share their course materials with ease. We must fight educational inequity. Higher education must 

The vision for OCMI is to create an open-source platform for course material sharing that is supported across universities similar to projects like [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/). Such a project requires:
* Advocacy effort to push for course material sharing
* Building an open source course material sharing platform
* Research into open education initiatives

OCMI's current full focus is the **Harvard Campaign:** pushing for course material sharing at Harvard. We are currently collecting Harvard faculty support for the (following letter)[ooep.org/OCMIAtHarvard]. Harvard faculty can sign the letter at [this form](ooep.org/OCMIAtHarvardForm) and more information for faculty can be found at [our FAQ document](ooep.org/ocmifaq). 

If you would like more information, do see our contact page at (ooep.org/contact)[ooep.org/contact]. If you would like to join the team, fill out the OCMI details at OOEP's general signup page at (ooep.org/signup)[ooep.org/signup]. Simply contacting and talking with faculty or sharing the OCMI message helps!
