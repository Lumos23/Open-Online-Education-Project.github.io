At OOEP we have four core teams: advocacy team, partnership management team, technology team, and the executive team. All of these roles are crucial to meeting the goals of OOEP. You can work in multiple roles. You do not need to be a student to work with OOEP. 

* **Advocacy Team:** Work on advocacy work for [OCMI](ocmi). Public communication (writing/speaking) and organizational skills are preferred. 

* **Partnership Management Team:** Establish connections and facilitate collaborations with other institutions. This can range from establishing and maintaining connections with individual courses to partnering with similar online education research programs at universities. 

* **Technology Team:** Build online edTech by becoming a software developer. Provide the use and maintenance of those tools with partners. Perform technical jobs in OOEP (e.g. webdesign). See [projects](projects) for a list of the open-source development project. 

* **Executive Team:** Coordinate across OOEP initiatives and projects. Develop strategy for OOEP development. Allocate resources to projects as needed and perform administrative duties. The executive team also handles recruiting, messaging (face of OOEP), and funding.
