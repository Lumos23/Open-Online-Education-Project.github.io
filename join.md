Join us and help explore the potential of online education. Together, we can make learning experience better across the globe!

For descriptions of current projects, please refer to [ooep.org/projects](https://ooep.org/projects).

The project board will be constantly updated as new projects are being added. We also welcome ideas for potential projects for people both within and outside OOEP to collaborate on.

At OOEP we have five central functions: development, advocacy, outreach/partnership management, research, and administration. All of these roles are crucial to meeting the goals of OOEP. You can work in multiple roles. You do not need to be a student to work with OOEP. 

* **Advocacy:** Work on an advocacy team (e.g. OCMI), skills for this vary on a case by case basis. Public communication (writing/speaking) and organizational skills are preferred. 

* **Outreach/Partnership Management:** Establish connections and collaborate with other institutions to address goals in online education. This can range from establishing and maintaining connections with a specific summer course to partnering with similar online education research programs at universities. 

* **Administration:** Keep track of current projects and find where resources need to be allocated. Develop strategies for OOEPâ€™s development. Administration also handles recruiting, messaging (face of OOEP), and funding.

* **Development:** Develop and implement online education tools. Communicate the use and maintenance of those tools with partners. Perform technical jobs in OOEP (e.g. webdesign). You can join onto an existing project, which can be found at ooep.org/projects or propose your own.

* **Research:** Identify and address novel problems in online education. Learn about the latest developments in online education and the best ways to implement them. Develop and maintain feedback-cycles between partners and development. Compile data and input from partnering research.

OOEP is organized as a coalition of projects. Projects are led by Project Managers (PMs) which largely decide how their project is run. However, to collaborate within OOEP, we require the following two things:

* The work produced is made freely available in some way. For example, development projects are open-source.

* Projects work to integrate with OOEP practices. For example, course partnership managers are expected to get regular feedback from courses and OOEP would provide technical support.
